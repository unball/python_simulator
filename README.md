# Simulator #

Simulator is a open-source executable made with python language to simulate the field of **[UnBall team](http://equipeunball.com.br/)**, in order to make it possible test the vision and also test the strategy.

-> Simulator was created using the libraries [Box-2D](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d) and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

## Dependencies ##

To install the dependecies, run

>Ubuntu:    
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example ## 
There is a script inside the python_simulator folder that contains an example called example.py explained how to run the simulator

## Running the simulator with Kaggle ##
To run the python simulator using a clould kernel like [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), follow the bellow instructions:
- Click on '+ Add data' on the right side of the screen;
- Choose 'Your Datasets' as your main filter;
- Click on 'Upload' and choose Github mode as the way to make the upload;
- This part is very important, write 'simulator' into the dataset title, without quotation masks
  and paste the link of simulator stored in Github, i.e. 'https://github.com/unball/python_simulator' without quotation masks

- You've added the libraries like a dataset in order to make possible import the simulator. Now you just need
  run the necessary cells to make all work well.
  If you didn't have any problem congratualions. Now, you can code you own code using the python_simulator 
  as an enviroment.... ;D
